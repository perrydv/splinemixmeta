GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                           Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>  
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

             Preamble
  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software
 and other kinds of works.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
 Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
 freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service
 if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it,
 that you can change the software and share your changes with others, and
 that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights.
 These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
 distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
 or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that
 you received. You must make sure that everyone else also receives or
 can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they
 know their rights.

  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
 (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer it to the public on
 these terms: our General Public Licenses.  For the developers’ own
 works, they can and do use different licenses.  But when they distribute
 others’ written work in combination with their own, they must keep the
 entire combination under the GPL.

  This is why we have adapted the GPL for use in the case of software
 that is released under it, rather than for other things.

  0. Background
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedoms to
 share and change it. By contrast, our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GPL for most of our software; it is our primary tool for protecting the freedom of the users.

  1. Applicability and Definitions
  a) This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under
    these terms.  The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work,
  and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any
  derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing
  the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications.
  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  The rights granted to you under
  this License represent the entire agreement between the parties and
  supersede any previous agreements.  If any provision of this License is
  held invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain in
  full force and effect.

  2. Freedom to Share and Change
  a) You have the freedom to share copies of the Program, therefore you
    need to know how to make a copy of it.  You have the freedom to change the
    Program and use parts of it in new free programs; therefore you need to be
    informed about how to change it.  Access to the source code is a precondition for this.

  3. Copyleft
  a) This is a key aspect of the GPL, which states that you can distribute
    your modified version only under the same license.  This ensures that the
    freedoms granted by the GPL are preserved in derivative works.

  4. Conclusion
  a) The GPL aims to preserve the freedom of the software in all its forms,
    ensuring that users can benefit from it without restrictions on sharing,
    modification, or usage.


 END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
  How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
 If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  If your software is a subroutine library, you might consider making it
  free software and telling your users how to apply it to other programs.

  You can apply these terms by including a copy of this license along with
  your program.  You should also make clear that you are the author of the
  original program, so others know who to credit.
