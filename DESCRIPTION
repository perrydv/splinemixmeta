Description: Fit additive mixed meta-analysis (AMMA) models, extending
  the mixmeta package <https://cran.r-project.org/package=mixmeta> 
  to allow for spline-based meta-regression. Functions combine features of 
  mgcv <https://cran.r-project.org/package=mgcv> for building spline 
  components and mixmeta for estimating general mixed-effects meta-analysis 
  models.
